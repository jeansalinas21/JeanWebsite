<h1>Letter To My Future Self</h1>
<p>Hey, Future Me!Its your younger self. How have you been? I hope by the time that I am reading this that I have already completed college. Do you have a job? Do you have your own appartment? Well I hope you do. Am I still friends with my friends from highschool or did we all go our seperate ways? How is mom and the family. I bet that they are really proud of you for graduating college. Right now I am  working on graduating high school. I hope that college won't be as bad as people say is. I hope that we become succesful and that we are happy.</p>
